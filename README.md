# IPL Data Set Analytics

## Description

**IPL Data Set Analytics** is a repository that collects data in **CSV** format and processes it to display bar plots using **Matplotlib.** The repository includes three datasets: **matches.csv, deliveries.csv, and allumpire.csv**. These datasets contain information about IPL matches, deliveries, and umpires.

The aim of this project is to perform various data analysis tasks on the IPL datasets and generate visualizations in the form of bar plots using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

To run the IPL Data Set Analytics project, ensure that you have the following requirements:

- Python 3 installed on your system.
- The required dependencies installed. You can install them by running the following command:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

The IPL Data Set Analytics project provides several functionalities. You can use the following files to perform specific analysis tasks:

1. `totalruns.py`: This file calculates and displays the total runs scored by each team in the IPL.

2. `topbatsman.py`: This file identifies and displays the top batsman for the Royal Challengers Bangalore team.

3. `foreign.py`: This file performs an analysis on foreign umpires in the IPL.

4. `stackedchart.py`: This file generates a stacked chart displaying the number of matches played by each team in each season.

To run the project, simply execute the desired file using Python 3. For example:

`python3 totalruns.py` 

Make sure you have the required datasets (`matches.csv`, `deliveries.csv`, and `allumpire.csv`) in the same directory as the Python files.
